Development for this project initially began shortly after I started learning to code. My goal with this project was to apply the skills that I had learned to an area of study that appeals to me, and as an aspiring astrophysicist, I thought it appropriate to develop something related to the field of astronomy. This project is based on a CSV file downloaded from https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PS and allows the user to generate custom plots of the data therein. As I learn more about astronomy/astrophysics and about computer science, I plan to continue to add to this project; I will consider it a measure of how much I have learned.
